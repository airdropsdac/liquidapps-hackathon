This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Make sure a local DSP node with enabled liquid-crypto service is running first on port `13015`.
This can be done by simply running the test once which does not shut down the nodes.

```bash
npm i
npm start
```
